     * @author Alex Biddulph, Trent Houliston
     *
     * @details Uses a set of particles (or samples) to represent possible states in a system. Each particle is randomly
     * selected from a multivariate normal distribution. Each particle is weighted by how likely it is to be the real
     * state of the system. Particles with a higher weight are more likely to be resampled (with noise) during the time
     * update.
     *
     * Time Update: Resamples all particles, perturbing the resampled particles with the model's process noise, and asks
     * the model to predict what should happen to each particle after an elapsed amount of time.
     *
     * Measurement Update: Asks the model to predict what the next measurement will be (based on current state/particle)
     * and the finds the difference between the model's prediction and the actual measurement. The likelihood of this
     * prediction occuring, given the measurement, is then determined using a multivariate normal distribution
     * probability density function.
     *
     * @tparam Scalar The scalar type to use for all calculations. This puts an upper bound on the numerical precision
     * that is achievable by the filter
     * @tparam FilterModel The model to use in the filtering process. This model needs to provide the equations that
     * models the system.
