\section{Introduction}
	This document outlines the scope of testing applied to the implementation of the new architecture for the RoboCup codebase. 
	The original architecture relied on purely manual processes for all testing.
	 
	We believe that the new architecture should utilise automated testing whenever feasible while using manual testing as a last-resort backup.
	
	In the new architecture functionality is separate into discrete modules that communicate through messages. 
	Accordingly we can separate our unit tests into per-module tests providing clean separation of concerns and simple mechanisms for mocking and validating inputs/outputs.
	We have also identified a number of cases where integration tests can be performed on module subsets further reducing the complexity of testing the system.
	End-to-end testing will still require manual validation as fully automated end-to-end testing would require an emulation layer for the robots hardware that was outside the scope of this project.

\section{Scope}
	The newly ported system has been split into many mutually exclusive sub modules and many are able to be tested in isolation using unit tests.
	Some of the modules however	must be manually tested due to their reliance on hardware in the system.
	An outline of the modules which have been ported and built on the new system as well as the testing method required is outlined below.
