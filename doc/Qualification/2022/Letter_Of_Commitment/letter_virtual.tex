\begin{letter}{RoboCup Humanoid League Technical Committee}
\opening{Dear Technical Committee Member:}

The NUbots team have participated in the RoboCup competition every year since 2002, including the 2021 virtual competition, and are dedicated to continue our strong contributions to the robotics field.

The RoboCup Technical Committee can be assured that the NUbots team are committed and have secured funding to participate in the RoboCup Humanoid League Virtual Season 2021/2022, with the intent to participate in the Kid-Size competition. As evident by our performance in the 2021 RoboCup competition and the 2021 Brazil Open competition, the team both has communication capabilities and an existing robot model that have been shown to work with the official Humanoid League Webots simulator environment.

The team is prepared to provide the necessary Docker image and robot model files on time. The team is also prepared to participate in the proposed workshops, as evident by our previous participation of the Virtual RoboCup Humanoid Open Workshops 2020.

Best regards, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 

\hspace*{20pt} Ysobel Sims

NUbots Team Leader
