\begin{letter}{RoboCup Humanoid League Technical Committee}
\opening{Dear Technical Committee Member:}
The NUbots team have participated in the RoboCup leagues every year since 2002, and are dedicated to continue our strong contributions to the robotics field.

We are submitting an application to both the Humanoid Kid-Size League and the Humanoid Adult-Size league. If we are accepted into both leagues then we will only seek to participate in the Humanoid Adult-Size league and will withdraw from the Humanoid Kid-Size league.

The RoboCup Technical Committee can be assured that the NUbots team are committed and have secured funding to attend the RoboCup 2020 competition in Bordeaux, France, with the intent to participate in one league.

We also commit, as evident by our previous years of refereeing experience at RoboCup, to provide a person who has sufficient knowledge of the rules to referee throughout the competition.

Best regards, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
