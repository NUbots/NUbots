\begin{letter}{RoboCup Humanoid League Technical/Organisational Committee}
\opening{Dear Technical/Organisational Committee Member:}

The NUbots team have participated in the RoboCup competition every year since 2002, including the 2021 virtual competition and 2021/2022 Virtual Season, and are dedicated to continue our strong contributions to the robotics field.

The RoboCup Humanoid Committee can be assured that the NUbots team are committed and have funding to participate in the RoboCup Humanoid League Virtual Season 2022/2023. As evident by our performance in the 2021 RoboCup competition and the 2021/2022 Virtual Season, NUbots can communicate over TCP with the Webots simulator and we have a Webots robot model for our NUgus robots, which have been used before with the official Humanoid League Webots simulator environment.

The team is prepared to provide the necessary Docker image and robot model files on time.

Kind regards, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\

NUbots Team Leader
