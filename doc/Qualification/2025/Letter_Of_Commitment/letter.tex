\begin{letter}{RoboCup Humanoid League Technical Committee}
\opening{Dear Technical Committee Member,}

The NUbots team have participated in the RoboCup competition every year since 2002 and are dedicated to continue our strong contributions to the robotics field.

The RoboCup Technical Committee can be assured that the NUbots team are committed and have secured funding to attend the RoboCup 2025 competition in Salvador Brazil, with the intent to participate in the Humanoid KidSize League.

We also commit, as evident by our previous years of refereeing experience at RoboCup, to provide a person who has sufficient knowledge of the rules to referee throughout the competition.

Best regards, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 

\hspace*{20pt} Mr. Clayton John Carlon

NUbots Team Leader
