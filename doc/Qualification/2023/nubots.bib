used for designing control systems, enhancing the stability of the robot and etc.

the safe way of educational and research purpose without damaging to the robot
in the real environment and reducing the cost of implementation. The structure
of the robot includes a rigid multibody of the robot, actuators, sensors and it can
be developed simply for other types of robots. For the gaiting purpose and other
movement control designing aims, the forward kinematics is solved by Denavit
Hartenberg (D-H) method and the analytical solution is used for solving the inverse kinematics. The kinematics chain consists of the head, Legs and arms of
the humanoid robot. The cad models of each part of the virtual humanoid robot
