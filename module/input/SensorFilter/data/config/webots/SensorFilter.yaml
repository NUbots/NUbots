# Yaw complementary filter for fusing gyroscope and kinematic estimates
yaw_filter:
  # Complementary filter coefficient (0-1)
  # Higher values give more weight to kinematic measurement, lower values to gyroscope prediction
  alpha: 0.1
  # Bias learning rate (0-1)
  # Higher values allow faster bias adaptation, lower values provide more stability
  # The filter automatically estimates and corrects for gyroscope bias drift
