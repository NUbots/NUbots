  gamma: 1.25                 # For 8-bit gamma is applied as OUT = 255 * (IN/255)^1/gamma. If 0, gamma will be disabled to create a linear response.

  sharpness: 1024             # For sharpness values greater than 1024, the pixel is sharpened; for values less than 1024 it is blurred. Averaged across a 3x3 block.
  hue: 100                   # Hue of the image in degrees.

  white_balance: [   1023,    1023] # Adjust the relative gain of R/V w.r.t G/Y and B/U w.r.t G/Y. End goal is to achieve a 1:1:1 ratio for the RGB channels.

                              # then all the reds should be scaled up by 232/222 and the blues down by 232/236.
                              # According to technical reference, defaults are 1023 for both R and B. (These are 12 bit values).
