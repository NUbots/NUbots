// Streamable HTTP server host (multi-session).
//
// Whereas `Server::run(transport)` runs one MCP session over one
// transport, an HTTP server hosts many sessions concurrently — one
// per `Mcp-Session-Id`. `HttpServerHost` is the coordinator: it owns
// the underlying HTTP listener, mints session ids, wires each
// session to a fresh `mcp::Server` populated by a user-supplied
// session factory, and tears sessions down on DELETE / idle / stop.
//
// Usage:
//
//   mcp::HttpServerHost host{
//       mcp::Implementation{.name = "calc", .version = "1.0"},
//       mcp::HttpServerHost::Options{
//           .host = "127.0.0.1",
//           .port = 8080,
//           .path = "/mcp",
//           .allowed_origins = {"https://example.com"},
//       },
//       [](mcp::Server& s) {
//           s.tool("add", schema, handler);
//       },
//   };
//   host.start();
//   // ...later...
//   host.stop();
