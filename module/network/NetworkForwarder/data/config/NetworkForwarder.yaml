# List the message types you want to send
# Depending on what value you put it will influence how it is sent:
#   false -> don't send this message type and disable the reaction
#   true -> attempt to send every message that you see of this type
#   number -> send messages at most at this framerate (e.g. if you put 10 it will send no more than 10 messages per second)
#             if you put in 0 here, it will act the same as if you put false
