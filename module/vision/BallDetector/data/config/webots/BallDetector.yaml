# Controls the minimum log level that NUClear log will display
log_level: INFO

confidence_threshold: 0.9 # Minimum confidence required for a ball point to be a ball point
cluster_points: 1 # Minimum number of points for a cluster to be a viable ball
minimum_ball_distance: 0.4 # Minimum distance for a cluster to be a viable ball
distance_disagreement:
  1.0 # Percentage difference between width and projection based distances. 0.0 means
  # the distance measurements must match perfectly
maximum_deviation:
  0.3 # A threshold on how large the standard deviation of the angle between ray and
  # cone axis can be
ball_angular_cov: [0.01, 0.01, 0.01] # Measurement certainties for ball localisation
