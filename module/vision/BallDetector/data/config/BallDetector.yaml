  dist_mode: eucl_dist # specifies the distance used during the seeding of initial means and k-means clustering:
    # Parameters for dist_mode:
    # eucl_dist     Euclidean distance
    # maha_dist     Mahalanobis distance, which uses a global diagonal covariance matrix estimated from the training samples

  seed_mode: random_spread # specifies how the initial means are seeded prior to running k-means and/or EM algorithms
    # Parameters for seed_mode:
    # keep_existing     keep the existing model (do not modify the means, covariances and hefts)
    # static_subset     a subset of the training samples (repeatable)
    # random_subset     a subset of the training samples (random)
    # static_spread     a maximally spread subset of training samples (repeatable)
    # random_spread     a maximally spread subset of training samples (random start)
