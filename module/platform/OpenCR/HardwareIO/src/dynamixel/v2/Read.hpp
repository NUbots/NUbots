     * @brief This struct mimics the expected data structure for a Read command.
     *
     * @details
     *  This type has it's members arranged in the same way as a raw array of this command would. Because of this
     *  you cannot add or remove members from this type. The template argument and parameter allows you to read any
     *  type. For example if you read with a uint16_t then it will read two bytes to the device. And if you use a
     *  struct with 3 uint16_t's in it, then you can directly read a parameter with an x, y and z bytes (e.g. the
     *  accelerometer)
     * @tparam T the type of data to be read
     *
